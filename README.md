# ra_dec_stellarium

A simple solution to transfer RA/DEC coordinates from a Plate Solving (e.g. local astrometry.net) program to Stellarium.

The coordinates refer to the centre point, the image orientation is not taken into account.

The input window is always at the top window level.

**RA/houers** 5:37:20.0 is entered as hours **HH**, minutes **MM** and seconds **SS**.
**DEC/degree** 24:20:51.8 is entered as 24.20518


All you need to install is Python 3 and the package pysimplegui

`pip3 install pysimplegui`

The programme is started via the console

`python3 ra_dec_stellarium.py`
