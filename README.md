# ra_dec_stellarium

A simple solution to transfer RA/DEC coordinates from a Plate Solving (e.g. local astrometry.net) program to Stellarium.

The coordinates refer to the centre point, the image orientation is not taken into account.

All you need to install is Python 3 and the package pysimplegui

`pip3 install pysimplegui`

The programme is started via the console

`python3 ra_dec_stellarium.py`
